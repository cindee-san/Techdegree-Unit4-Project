# Techdegree-Unit4-Project
In this unit I learned about Object Oriented Programming in the JavaScript programming language
## Phrase Hunter
For project 4 of my Treehouse Techdegree, I was asked to create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." I used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase. The player (you!) tries to guess the phrase by selecting individual letters from an onscreen keyboard. Can you guess the phrase before you run out of attempts?
